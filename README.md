# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-means-Clustering
The goal of K means is to group data points into distinct non-overlapping subgroups. One of the major application of K means clustering is segmentation of customers to get a better understanding of them which in turn could be used to increase the revenue of the company. Customer Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits. In the first step of this data science project, we will perform data exploration. We will import the essential packages required for this role and then read our data. Finally, we will go through the input data to gain necessary insights about it.

K-Means Clustering is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. It tries to make the intra-cluster data points as similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different (far) as possible. It assigns data points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and the clusterâ€™s centroid is at the minimum. The less variation we have within clusters, the more homogeneous the data points are within the same cluster. We then proceeded to perform K-means Clustering which will create different clusters to group similar spending activity based on their age and annual income. KMeans Clustering selects random values from the data and forms clusters assigned. The closest values from the centre of each cluster were taken to update the cluster and reshape the plot (just like k-NN). The closest values are based on Euclidean Distance.

The goal of this project is to 
   1. Perform an exploratory analysis on the dataset.
   2. Check that the assumptions K-means makes are fulfilled.
   3. Apply K-means clustering algorithm in order to segment customers.
